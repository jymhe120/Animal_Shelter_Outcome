# Animal_Shelter_Outcome
MSIS 2802 Python final project

The data comes from Austin Animal Shelter, and I downloaded the csv files from a ![Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes).
The dataset features cats and dogs that are taken in by the Animal Shelter, their breed, color, age and etc., and the eventual outcome of these animals.
This analysis focuses on finding out what feature/attribute contributes the most to higher adoption rate for these sheltered animals.
